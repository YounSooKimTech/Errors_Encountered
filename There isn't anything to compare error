For future me:
when you encounter an error in "Compare & Pull request",
especially it says "There isn't anything to compare", 
do this.

1. git pull -f origin master : not working
2. git reset --soft master : not working

3. git pull origin master(or main) --allow-unrelated-histories : it is working!
"""



$ git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories



# then you will see "write reasons". Follow the steps

"""
1. "press "i" to inset
2. write down your message (e.g., "I made an important change, but the repo does not accept it")
3. press "esc" to escpae writing mode
4. write ":wq" to write and quit
5. press enter
"""

Now, future me, you will going to wonder about
why I wasted so much time for this simple problem.
Future me, you owe now me.
